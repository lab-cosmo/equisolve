    If `n_to_select` is an `int`, all blocks will have this many features
    selected. In this case, `n_to_select` must be <= than the fewest number of
    features in any block.

    If `n_to_select` is a dict, it must have keys that are tuples corresponding
    to the key values of each block. In this case, the values of the
    `n_to_select` dict can be int that specify different number of features to

    If `n_to_select` is -1, all features for every block will be selected. This

    accessed through the selector.haussdorf_at_select property after calling the
    fit() method.
